Recently I am working on a project to revamp the UI of a particular website, here are some the problems I have faced:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I started to ""web parts"" concept to pull content from different page via ajax. However I have name/id clashes. Eg. the main page has a tag , and the web part that I am pulling over also has a tag </p></li>
<li><p>There are more than 1 guy writing javascripts, sometimes writing library code, sometimes writing page specific code. And we have naming clashes... </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I was thinking to standardize the naming convention to something like this: global variables will have ""global_"" prefixes, page specific code should have ""[pagename]_"" prefixes(however, we will see a lot of clashes for index.html)</p>

<p>Hence I am asking if anyone has a pretty solid standardization to share with?</p>

<p>Am I blind for yet another obscure svcutil.exe parameter, or is there really no way to generate this documentation in the metadata automatically??</p>

<p>EDIT: ok, based on Marc Gravell's answer, the comments and documentation strings aren't in either the compiled DLL, nor available over the MEX metadata exchange protocol (pity!).</p>

<p>SO THEN: How do you document your WCF services, if you need to give a third-party the information they need to access your service?? Is there a ""NService"" or ""Sandcastle for WCF"" tool around that would scan my WCF service library and construct the WSDL and XSD from source code, including the annotations??</p>

<p>To achive the highlight i use javascript with:</p>

 var target = $('#page').html();
 var re = new RegExp(searchTxt, 'gi');
 target = target.replace(

<p>Is it possible to solve this with regexp, somehow excluding anything anjcent to "".jpg""?</p>

<p>Or would it be possible to, before highligting replace the images with placeholders, and after replace revert back to src?</p>

<li>Do the replace above.</li>

I recently added a bunch of new C++ functions callable by Lua, and am wondering how to best document them, and at the same time also stimulate people to write/update documentation for <em>a lot</em> of existing Lua call-outs.</p>

<p>So I figured it may be nice if I could write the documentation initially as doxygen comments near the C++ functions - this is easy because the function body obviously defines exactly what the function does. However, I would like the documentation to be improved by game developers using the engine, who generally have little understanding of git (the VCS we use) or C++.</p>

<p>Hence, it would be ideal if there was a way to automatically generate apidocs from the C++ file, but also to have a wiki-like web interface to allow a much wider audience to update the comments, add examples, etc.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering, does there exist a web tool which integrates doxygen style formatting, wiki-like editing for those comments (preferably without allowing editing any other parts of the source file) and git? (to commit the comments changed through the web interface to a special branch)</p>

<p>We developers could then merge this branch every now and then to add the improvements to the master branch, and at the same time any improvements by developers to the documentation would end up on this web tool with just a merge of the master branch into this special branch.</p>

 will generate a graph for each documented class showing the direct and
 indirect implementation dependencies (inheritance, containment, and
 class references variables) of the class with other documented classes.</p>

<p>Currently, the library has a two identical functions like</p>

<p><code><pre>

*
* @param {String} the url of the spreadsheet
* @return {SpreadsheetQuery_} a spreadsheet query object for the given spreadsheet

All the functionality will be provided by the object and it will be great if GAS could show the methods on it.</p>

Seba,M,,403887,1286,How to properly document an extension method,"<p>So, I have a few extension methods, for commonly used stuff, and in documenting them, it's occurred to me that I have <em>no idea</em> how to consistently write the <code>summary</code> tag in the XML comments. For example:</p>

<pre><code> /// &lt;summary&gt;
 /// Gets a subset of characters from the left-hand side of a string.
 /// &lt;/summary&gt;
 public static string Left(this string value, int length)
</code></pre>

<pre><code> /// &lt;summary&gt;
 /// Gets the name of the month for this date.
 /// &lt;/summary&gt;

<p>So the question is, what guidance is there for documenting extension methods? If there is no formal guidance, how do you all handle it?

the official documentation for JS i know is <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference</a> <br>
<br> But i am curious if this also is the right place to look for when talking about NodeJS.<br>
Here : <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date</a> is the documentation about the <code>Date</code><br></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Constructor:<br>
 new Date(year, monthIndex [, day [, hours [, minutes [, seconds [, milliseconds]]]]]);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and also</p>

<blockquote>
 <p><code>year</code>
 Integer value representing the year. Values from 0 to 99 map to the years 1900 to 1999; all other values are the actual year. See the example below.<br><br>
 <code>monthIndex</code> Integer value representing the month, <strong>beginning with 0 for January to 11 for December</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If i execute the following code in Chrome i get a different result than in node JS CLI:</p>

<pre><code>let d = new Date(2017,0,1);
console.log(d);
</code></pre>

<p>The Chrome result is what i expect regarding to the documentation:</p>

<pre><code>Sun Jan 01 2017 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Mitteleuropäische Normalzeit)

<p>The NodeJS result is other than expected based on monthIndex from 0 to 11</p>

<pre><code>2016-12-31T23:00:00.000Z
</code></pre>

<p>Aditional the format seems different. So where is the official documentation for NodeJS as the MDN documentation doesn't seem to apply for NodeJS</p>

<p>EDIT:
The ECMA documentation (which is the official versiona also states the range to be 0 - 11 and not 1-12)</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Months are identified by an integer in the range 0 to 11, inclusive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT 2:
The implementation seems different for node and Chrome(any Browser) due time zones. So browsers in time zone GMT +1 are one hour ahead of node (at least from the dd.MM.yyyy representation)</p>

<p>But why isn't node returning 1.1.2017 00:00 and browsers 1.1.2017 01:00 GTM +0100
?</p>

<h2>----------------------[Solution]-------------------------<br></h2>

<p>When you use <code>new Date([Whatever])</code> it allways create the date in your time zone.<br>
But depending of the implementation it shows in GMT +0000 or in your own timezone.<br>
So if you like to create an date and you don't care about the timezone which will mostly be the case on NodeJS you should use Date.UTC to create The date in GTM +0000</p>",javascript node.js reference documentation,1,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57606761,1,,

M,P,,16681545,67,Removing a JavaScript comment through commands?,"<p>I am currently developing a website that relies heavily on large blocks of javascript for widgets. Some of these are demanding processes, such as running timers or clocks, so I only want these scripts to activate when their corresponding widget is activated. My proposed solution is to comment out each of these blocks of scripts, and ""uncomment"" them when the widget is active.</p>

<p>For example, if I have a countdown timer widget, I would like to have my code for the widget completely commented out until the user clicks the widget. When the user opens the widget, I would like the corresponding scripts to become ""uncommented"" and execute.</p>

At the moment, I have one class (the game's environment) responsible for holding collections of game objects (enemies, weapons, etc.) and doing collision-checks, calling the objects' creation routines, etc. As I've progressed with the project, I've started to wonder if I should have a more layered approach - is it better to have, say, a WeaponsManager, an EnemiesManager, and an Environment holding everything together, or to have my Environment class manipulating each object as I'm doing right now?</p>

<p>It might be worth mentioning that the game objects are already fairly heavily layered:</p>

<pre></pre>

<p>BaseClass has basic object properties defined, such as position. EnemyClass and WeaponClass are fairly generic classes that define more class-specific methods and properties, such as speed for EnemyClass or damage for WeaponClass. They mostly exist so I can have fairly generic collections instead of a separate collection for each individual enemy/weapon type. Enemy1Subclass/Enemy2Subclass and Weapon1Subclass/Weapon2Subclass are the actual enemy/weapon classes, which are actually created and used.</p>

<p>My Environment class stores collections of EnemyClass/WeaponClass and does the necessary manipulation by calling the game objects' methods.</p>

M,P,,17774350,86,What are examples of comments that tell you WHY instead of HOW or WHAT?,"<p>First of all, in this question I'd like to stay away from the polemic on whether source code commenting is good or bad. I'm just trying to understand more clearly what people mean when they talk about comments that tell you WHY, WHAT or HOW.</p>

<p>We often see guidelines like ""Comments should tell you WHY; code itself should tell you HOW"". It is easy to agree with the statement on an abstract level. However, people usually drop this like a dogma, and leave the room without further explanation. I've seen this used in so many different places and contexts, that it looks like people can agree on the catchphrase, but they seem to be talking about different things entirely.</p>

<p>So, back to the question: if comments should tell you WHY, what is this WHY we are talking about? Is this the reason why that piece of code exists in the first place? Is this what that piece code should be doing? I would really appreciate if someone could give a clear explanation, and then add some good examples (bad examples are not really needed, but fell free to add them for contrast).</p>

<p>Please do not immediately close this question as duplicate or polemic. I have tried hard to make it very objective. There are many questions on whether comments are good or bad, but no one that addresses the specific question of what are good examples of comments that tell you WHY.</p>

<p><strong>First example</strong></p>

<p>I have an activity that displays a level of the game. However, the data required for that level (background artwork, entities etc.) is stored in a separate class. Naturally, I would call the latter class <code>Level</code>. However, I would call the activity <code>Level</code> as well, because it displays levels.</p>

<p><strong>Second example</strong></p>

<p>I have an activity that plays back a cut scene. It basically displays several images in a row. The information which image is shown for how long is stored in a separate class. As in the previous case, I would naturally call both classes <code>CutScene</code>.</p>

<p>How would you solve these naming issues? Name the activities <code>LevelActivity</code> and <code>CutSceneActivity</code>?

So, if I had a collection of Car objects, I would typically name a <code>Car[]</code> <code>carArray</code> and a <code>List&lt;Car&gt;</code> <code>carList</code>.</p>

<p>And then 99% of the time, I end up just doing something like...</p>

<pre><code>foreach (Car car in carArray)
{
 ...
}

<p>...and I'm thinking, I could have just called the array <code>cars</code>, and it wouldn't have made any difference.</p>

<p>And now that we have <code>IEnumberable&lt;T&gt;</code>, I'm actually faced with the question of whether I might consider writing something like <code>carIEnumerable</code>? or <code>carEnumerable</code>. So far, the answer has been ""no"".</p>

<p>My thinking here is that the type of collection <em>often</em> doesn't matter, and when it does, is still doesn't matter if the collection type is written into the variable name. I just had a case where I had to switch from an <code>IEnumerable&lt;Car&gt;</code> to a <code>List&lt;Car&gt;</code> because I needed ""bracket access"" to the items (e.g., <code>carList[3]</code>). In that case, the two collection types do not behave the same, but would naming the variable <code>cars</code> have been a problem here?</p>

<p>Not to add another layer of complexity to this question, what happens if I use <code>var</code>? E.g.,</p>

<pre><code>var cars = GetCars();
</code></pre>

<p>I can certainly tell <code>cars</code> is some kind of collection. I can iterate it. If I'm using LINQ, I can use extension methods. More importantly, if I later change up the type of collection, there would be much less code to mess with. <code>var</code> would still be <code>var</code> and <code>cars</code> would still be <code>cars</code>. That seems very appealing to me, and I having trouble seeing much disadvantage.</p>

- View.php (the view class)
- Model.php (the model class, in my case I try no to use more than 2 models per action)
- template.php (the HTML template which is loaded by the View)
- language.php (a language file that loads translations)

<p>In my framework, the router and the controller are in the same file, because I don't really use a router, I simply parse actions from the _GET and _POST

M,Seba,,7540300,1476,Adding comments mod into Smarty Template PHP site,"<p>My site is built around X-Cart 4.2.3, which is built around Smarty Templates. I am trying to figure out a way to add Facebook Comments to my dynamic product pages (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/). These have to have unique URLs for each product page. I found an X-cart wiki on how to add the LIKE button, which I did successfully. This was the code for the LIKE button:</p>

<pre></pre>

<p>The code above is exactly the same as what Facebook's tool spits out, except for the dynamic URL variable: {$php_url.url|escape:""url""}
I wanted to basically repeat the same process for the COMMENTS module, but that one is strictly xfbml, rather than iframe, which creates two problems:
Problem 1: even if I paste the xfbml code verbatim into my product.tpl template, I can't get the comments mod to show up on the front end of the store. Same thing happens with the xfbml code of the LIKE button. Only iframe seems to work.
Problem 2: even if I solve the first problem, how to I utilize the URL variable in the fb tag, since it has quotes around the URL?

<p>We had a JSON contract established between two different groups, namely UI team dealing with React based framework and Server team developing REST services in Java. The one thing that was not captured is what should be sent and retrieved for ‘empty’ objects. I would like to know if there are any known JSON conventions which mandates empty object to be sent in certain ways.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I’m referring to </p>

<pre></pre>

<p>When an empty object like</p>

<pre></pre>

<p>is sent from UI application to REST services, I am of the opinion, it is fair to expect the same object back. The server team complains that due to the nature of the service/JSON mapping, when an empty object is sent, the returned object will have null attributes like below:</p>

<pre></pre>

<p>Unfortunately this is an area where clear definition of empty objects was not captured during the template agreement. The server team claims this is what is defined in JSON spec, which is not clear from <a href=""http://www.json.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.json.org/</a></p>

<p>Additional information about the contract:</p>

<blockquote>
 <ol>
 <li>The REST services are for storage and retrieval of the JSON objects and is not expected to make any modifications to the JSON object.</li>
 <li>There is also no calculation, aggregation or translation of any sort that is expected from the REST services.</li>
 <li>The JSON is sent to additional downstream systems from the middleware services(Server team).</li>
 </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Additional information about the implications of this problem:</p>

<blockquote>
 <ol>
 <li>UI application(React based) has issues in merging null values from JSON into immutable structure(for UI consumption). Empty objects are very well handled, however objects with null attributes requires additional overhead.</li>
 <li>REST services are developed in Java due to which the empty objects are always returned with <strong><em>attributes</em></strong> having null values.</li>
 </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Question: </p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Is it correct for the server team to refer to JSON specification and claim 'when empty objects are sent to REST services(without attributes), it will always be sent back with <strong><em>attributes</em></strong> having null values? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: I am not looking for help with the problems faced in UI application or how to achieve the requisite JSON structure in REST services.</p>",json rest standards conventions json-spec,1,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43714718,1,,

Unfortunately I'm not all that sure what the conventional way is.</p>

<p>Ideally I want a link to an in depth online resource that discusses this and surrounding topics in depth, but I'm having difficulty finding keywords that will locate this on google.</p>

<p>At the start of my script I set a bunch of global variables that store the names of the dirs that it will be accessing, this means that I can modify the dir's quickly, but this is programming shortcuts, not user shortcuts, I can't tell the users that they have to fiddle with this stuff. Also, I need for individual users' settings not to get wiped out on every upgrade.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>Name of settings folder: ~/.foo/ -- this is well and good, but how do I keep my working copy and my development copy separate? tweek the reference in the source of the dev version?</p>

<p>If my program needs to maintain and update library of data (gps tracklog data in this case) where should this directory be? the user will need to access some of this data, but it's mostly for internal use. I personally work in cygwin, and I like to keep this data on separate drive, so the path is wierd, I suspect many users could find this. for a default however I'm thinking ~/gpsdata/ -- would this be normal, or should I hard code a system that ask the user at first run where to put it, and stores this in the settings folder? whatever happens I'm going ot have to store the directory reference in a file in the settings folder.</p>

<p>The program needs a data ""inbox"" that is a folder that the user can dump files, then run the script to process these files. I was thinking ~/gpsdata/in/ ?? though there will always be an option to add a file or folder to the command line to use that as well (it processed files all locations listed, including the ""inbox"")</p>

<p>Where should the script its self go? it's already smart enough that it can create all of it's ancillary/settings files (once I figure out the ""correct"" directory) if run with ""./foo --setup"" I could shove it in /usr/bin/ or /bin or ~/.foo/bin (and add that to the path) what's normal?</p>

<p>I need to store login details for a web service that it will connect to (using curl -u if it matters) plan on including a setting whereby it asks for a username and password every execution, but it currently stores it plane text in a file in ~/.foo/ -- I know, this is not good. The webservice (osm.org) does support oauth, but I have no idea how to get curl to use it -- getting curl to speak to the service in the first place was a hack. Is there a simple way to do a really basic encryption on a file like this to deter idiots armed with notepad?</p>

M,Seba,,30111928,48,Is it wrong to use partials in this way?,"<p>Ok so I am developing a website in rails right now. Basically it is a static site (but I am using rails because eventually my client wants blog and post functionality added in), which has a bunch of different sections with different articles in each section. Each article is designed with it's own html structure, some have tables, divs, font coloring, etc. so storing these articles as text in the database doesn't make sense. However, it also didn't seem to make sense to have an entirely separate html file for each article in each section when they'r parent element is going to have the same common structure (what I mean by this, is each section on the site, like about, or publications, are going to have they're own unique layout, however, every article belonging to a given section will be placed in the same div as their sister articles. </p>

<p>So I had an idea. I thought I would use partials for rendering unique content in the same layout for each section. (keep in mind that nothing is currently stored in a database.) So I am thinking of setting the site up to have different view folders for the sections, and, inside each of those view folders I will have another folder titled ""content,"" in which I will put the specific html for a given route. </p>

<p>For example, one of my 'about' routes looks like this </p>

<pre></pre>

<p>Which sends the parameter :pagename over to the controller for the show method, at which point I capture that parameter into a variable (in the about_controller.rb file)</p>

<pre></pre>

<p>And then the show.html.erb view renders a partial with the same name as the @content variable.</p>

<pre></pre>

<p>At this point, the view looks inside the content folder for the specific partial it is called with, and renders that html.</p>

<p>My question is.... Is this unconventional? I am pretty sure I know the answer to that question... which is yes. So my follow up question is how bad is it? Are there any huge website-shattering problems this will cause that I can't forsee with my limited rails experience?

M,Seba,,21169844,2609,What is a popular JavaDoc practice for ASCII-art documentation?,"<p>I'm working on a project written in Java, designed to transmit data via a messaging system that strictly defines the bit position of the messages fields. This means we have an entire library of dictionary classes designed to bit-shift object input data to/from the message binary representation. This library is reasonably large, and because the protocol is still young, has the tendency to be tweaked and changed every year or so.</p>

<p>The JavaDoc for this library provides ASCII art tables and diagrams that explain what a particular method expects as input (or output). These tables are exceedingly important because finding the documentation and verifying that the method actually does what the document says can be time consuming a prone to error. Following a single, simple ASCII-representation of the bit shifting makes this a lot easier.</p>

<p>I have a coworker who insists that ASCII art does not belong in JavaDoc (even with tags), and furthermore that we configure Eclipse to automatically format the code on save. He offers two options to reformat the documentation: </p>

<ol>
<li>Embed an image.</li>
<li>Use an HTML table.</li>
</ol>

<p>The image would be okay, except Eclipse doesn't render SVG images. It is completely unacceptable to me that we maintain an SVG image and then export the image as PNG to our documentation repo, and then link the PNG with HTML. The amount of maintenance involved in that scenario seems completely crazy. Who is responsible for making sure all the PNG, SVG, and code are synchronized?? Furthermore, obviously, the data won't be readable without the image.</p>

<p>The HTML table option is bad for two reasons. First, the Eclipse formatter puts <em>each tag and value on it's own line</em>, which means every single value takes up three lines. It leaves huge gaps in the source code, and is completely unreadable without rendering the HTML. To make matters worse, some of our tables are complex, and troubleshooting HTML tables is not my idea of a responsible thing to require of developers who already resist creating documentation.</p>

<p>So if my coworker is right about ""java people"" not using ASCII diagrams for documentation, what is a standard, industry practice, that gives us a method for preserving these diagrams? How does this method benefit over using tags with ASCII diagrams? Bonus points if you can answer why JavaDoc hasn't evolved to provide readable markup, instead of relying on HTML.</p>

The concept of tags should be familiar to most users right now, but I'm not so sure hierarchical tags are, nor does the abstraction of tags completely fit.</p>

<p>What I have is actually something between folders and tags, in that each subtag is a proper subset of its parents. To get the contents of a folder-tag-thing you take its contents plus the contents of its sub-folder-tag-things and do that recursively. In a way they're like (and here's where I just partially answered my own question in the process of asking it) categories. What do you guys think of calling them categories? What kind of icon would you give it, since a category is an abstract concept rather than a physical object that can take a shape?</p>

<p>(Can wiki if requested)</p>

<p>Edit: For clarification, what I'm looking for is an abstraction for an end-user like Aunt Sally that easily grasp the concept. Ideally there is also a graphical representation (an icon) that can be easily associated with that concept.</p>

<p>Edit2: One thing I did forget to mention is that an item can exist in more than on category (much like how Google Doc allows you to add an document to multiple folders). I guess I've kind sold myself on calling them categories. It just fits everything you can do with them. Something can belong to a more than one category, subcategories make sense, most subcategories people normally create lend themselves to an is-a relationship (for example, a Windows user might have say a folder called resumes in their My Documents folder, because a resume is a document, it would make sense that it's in My Documents as well if you think of the folders as categories)</p>

<p>What I still haven't figured out is the icon (I'm 99% sure I'm going to be using some kind of TreeView to display them in) I could just use a folder icon I suppose, maybe a custom folder-like icon unless anyone else has a better idea. Google calls them folders, so I guess it can't be too bad right?</p>

P,Seba,,43445184,696,How to self-document a callback function that is called by template library class?,"<p>I have a function <code>User::func()</code>(callback) that would be called by a template class (<code>Library&lt;T&gt;</code>). </p>

<p>In the first iteration of development, everyone know that <code>func()</code> serves only for that single purpose.<br>
A few months later, most members forget what <code>func()</code> is for.<br>
After some heavy refactoring, the <code>func()</code> is sometimes deleted by some coders. </p>

<p>At first, I didn't think this is a problem at all.<br>
However, after I re-encountered this <em>pattern</em> several times, I think I need some counter-measure.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How to document it elegantly? (cute &amp;&amp; concise &amp;&amp; no additional CPU cost) </p>

<h1>Example</h1>

<p>Here is a simplified code:-<br>
 (The real world problem is scattering around 10+ library-files &amp; 20+ user files &amp; 40+ functions.)</p>

<p><strong>Library.h</strong> </p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt; class Library{
 public: T* node=nullptr;
 public: void utility(){
 node-&gt;func(); //#1
 }
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>User.h</strong></p>

<pre><code>class User{
 public: void func(){/** some code*/} //#1
 //... a lot of other functions ...
 // some of them are also callback of other libraries
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>main.cpp</strong></p>

<pre><code>int main(){
 Library&lt;User&gt; li; .... ; li.utility();
}
</code></pre>

<h1>My poor solutions</h1>

<h2>1. Comment / doc</h2>

<p>As the first workaround, I tend to add a comment like this:-</p>

<pre><code>class User{ 
 /** This function is for ""Library"" callback */
 public: void func(){/** some code*/}
};
</code></pre>

<p>But it gets dirty pretty fast - I have to add it to every ""func"" in every class.</p>

<h2>2. Rename the ""func()""</h2>

<p>In real case, I tend to prefix function name like this:-</p>

<pre><code>class User{ 
 public: void LIBRARY_func(){/** some code*/}
};
</code></pre>

<p>It is very noticeable, but the function name is now very longer.<br>
(especially when <code>Library</code>-class has longer class name)</p>

<h2>3. Virtual class with ""func()=0""</h2>

<p>I am considering to create an abstract class as interface for the callback.</p>

<pre><code>class LibraryCallback{ 
 public: virtual void func()=0;
};
class User : public LibraryCallback{ 
 public: virtual void func(){/** some code*/}
};
</code></pre>

<p>It provides feeling that <code>func()</code> is for <strong><em>something-quite-external</em></strong>. <code>:)</code><br>
However, I have to sacrifice virtual-calling cost (v-table).<br>
In performance-critical cases, I can't afford it.</p>

<h2>4. Static function</h2>

<p><em>(idea from Daniel Jour in comment, thank!)</em> </p>

<p>Almost 1 month later, here is how I use :- </p>

<p><strong>Library.h</strong> </p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt; class Library{
 public: T* node=nullptr;
 public: void utility(){
 T::func(node); //#1
 }
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>User.h</strong></p>

<pre><code>class User{
 public: static void func(Callback*){/** some code*/} 
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>main.cpp</strong></p>

<pre><code>int main(){
 Library&lt;User&gt; li;
}
</code></pre>

P,Seba,,25455995,664,More efficient and readable nested loop,"<p>I've created an algorithm which weighs the relevance of a list of articles against two lists of keywords that correlate to attributes of the article.</p>

<p>It works great and is super efficient... but it's a mess. It's not terribly readable, so it's difficult to discern what's going.</p>

<p>The operation in pseudo code goes something like this:</p>

<ul>

<li>For every article, loop through every role in a list of roles <code>(List&lt;string&gt;)</code></li>

<li>If yes, then loop through each role in the article and try to match a role in the article to the role in the current loop</li>
<li>If a match is found, add weight to the article. If the index of the role on the article and the role in the roles list are both index 0 (in primary position) add extra weight for two matching primaries</li>
<li>Repeat for topics, but with no bonus for primary matches</li>

<p>For example, in HTML</p>

<pre></pre>

<p>in this case, the outer comment ends on the first instead of the corresponding last one, causing the last to print, when it shouldn't.</p>

<p>But my question is WHY is it that way? Why, by design, it is not allowed? I mention ""by design"" because I really doubt it is because of parsing problems, I guess the parsers are perfectly capable of keeping track of opening s and close the comments with their corresponding closing s But they simply somehow decided it is not a good idea.</p>

<p>I already know that a workaround for this is to somehow change the inner closing comments, to avoid them to close , and only leave the last closing one. e.g. changing inner s and s for s and s . But that is obviously not convenient, and hard to do when you only want to discard blocks of code for debugging purposes. (other techniques are to nest everything in blocks, but that is not the point here.</p>

Either that I passed a nil.comments error or an undefined object/method (can't remember). </p>

<p>My question is what do I need to included in the post_controller, the comments_controller and the index.html.erb file to accomplish this. To be complete I have included the code in each below. </p>

sheet two has maintenance actions ascending. a few of the columns are: date, maint action and number of workers. some of the columns in sheet 2 have the info that i manually type in on sheet1(the schedule) as comments, number of workers is one i always add to the comment. it would be a big time saver if i didnt have to type these all in.
what i would like to create:
sheet2 has the date that the maint action will take place, sheet1 has dates across the top. i would like to have a macro find the date column in sheet1 that matches the date in sheet2, then find the row in sheet1 that matches the equipmentID in sheet2 for that maint action. then the comment can just be compiled as a string of that rows info in sheet2 and written as a comment on sheet1. </p>

<p>so kinda like this. click button on sheet2. it finds the cell on sheet1 that lines up with the date column and equipmentID row. compiles a comment from sheet2 cells b3,b4,b5. insert comment in the found cell in sheet1. then loop for each maint action on sheet2.
should probably clear all comments of the found cells before inserting the new one. </p>
